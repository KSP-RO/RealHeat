This is a simple mod to correct some temperature-related things in KSP's thermal model. Later it will replace things wholesale, building on the work of goozeman and SRFirefox in addition to those above.

Right now it will:
* Calculate a shock temperature based on atmospheric composition and velocity.
* Calculate gamma based on atmospheric composition and velocity.
* Recalculate background radiation temperature (and the density-based interpolation factor used there and in other things) based on the above.

Installation:
Extract RealHeat folder and ModularFlightIntegrator folders to GameData.

Changelog:
v1.1
* Supports changing aeroFX now. Defaults to making it intense down low, so you can set the normal aeroFX settings to much lower scaling to not have flames on ascent.

v1.0
* Initial release version of RealHeat for KSP 1.0.4.
